In any directory: "git clone https://github.com/Andrey000/reverse.git".
If not installed, do sudo apt install make build-essential.
After executing “git clone https://github.com/Andrey000/reverse.git”, reverse.cpp and Makefile and Readme files will appear in the directory.
Run make and get a working reverse program.
Run it ./reverse.
Open a new terminal. Enter telnet localhost 28888.
Next, enter arbitrary strings and by pressing 'Enter' we get reversed strings, which the server returns in response.
Tested on ubuntu-20.04.
